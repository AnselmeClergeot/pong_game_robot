Java program who plays for you against the IA at PONG game http://www.ponggame.org/. Noob IA versus unbeatable IA !

Live development news :

**Corrected errors on the ball position prediction algorithm, now the robot wins against the beginner oponent (sometimes).**

**My robot is losing because when the ball spanws again when I scored, the ScreenAnalyzer do not have enough time to calculate ball direction, so the pad moves way too late and looses ball... And so on.**
